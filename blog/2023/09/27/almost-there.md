Hello everyone, long time no see. For one reason or another, this article was written.

<!--truncate-->

First of all, this article was written purely as debug material in the API exchange response between docusaurus and our internal platform.

And the second is an apology to myself because ArchivD, as a product, requires a lot of additional time in the development process, mainly because personal matters are not getting better so it takes up a lot of time.

However, despite this, ArchivD is still being actively developed and could be released to the public in the near future. Thank you to myself for continuing to believe that ArchivD can become a product.

And thank you also to the users who read this article. Thank you for being a witness to my struggle over the years in developing ArchivD.

Best regards, Waka.
