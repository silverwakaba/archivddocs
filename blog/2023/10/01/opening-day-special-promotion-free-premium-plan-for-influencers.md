After many tiring days of development and testing, finally the day I had been waiting for (and also worry) had arrived. ArchivD, as my first (proper) product in the SaaS business, has finally been officially launched to the public.

<!--truncate-->

The birth of ArchivD as a product certainly brings me to a new chapter and desire within me. A big hope like "*hopefully this project can change the way of sharing files as I envision it*" or something as simple as "*hopefully this project can run smoothly*" flashes in my mind.

However, these ideals and hopes will never be achieved if ArchivD does not have its users. Advertising might be the quickest solution to get it, but it seems like I'd rather not do it.

The reason is quite simple and ridiculous; My budget is completely allocated to operational costs, since those servers are not charity goods which can run at no cost.

Tldr, as a matter of transparency; Yes, the budget can run ArchivD for the next few years (probably 1 - 2 years without income). And no, there is no budget I can cut for advertising purposes because of it. I probably could cut the budget to use in the advertising process, but of course that could lower the estimated service life if it runs without income. But I just don't want to.

## So, what is the solution?

For now I want to create a promotion specifically for owners/managers of popular websites, blogs or groups who have a niche or need in file sharing/distribution. The promotion is a simple "Free premium plan worth one year." This way Maybe I can get new users from the base they already have. Who knows, but since the niche or needs is really clicked... I hope so.

Maybe right now I can't advertise using money, but I will try to advertise using this kinda social experiments.

Because if this promotion runs smoothly I think the results will be very good. As a project owner, of course I get new potential users and users can also immediately try ArchivD as a product. With the performance and service that ArchivD provides, I am very confident that the majority of potential users can then become loyal users.

In the end, I prefer to use this promotion because I can directly return the benefits to the community instead of having to spend money on advertising agencies, right?

## Who is eligible?

Short answer short, owners/managers of popular websites, blogs or groups who have a niche or need in file sharing/distribution. The way to measure popularity may revolve around the ranking of the website/blog and also the intensity of the interactions that occur.

## How to apply

I will send a DM regarding this promotion personally to people/organizations who I feel meet the requirements and criteria above. If you are part of this then you just need to simply redeem the code that I have provided on the [redemption page](https://archivd.net/app/setting/reseller/redeem).

If not but you feel interested, you can directly apply your websites, blogs or groups via Discord DM (wakakuro) or through email at support@silverspoon.me. After that I will see and determine the results.

## But is ArchivD good?

## How many coupons are distributed?

Tbh I don't know, but maybe about 200 coupons equals to $15.000, if we use the current premium price for one year. Well, it is what it is. It's not a bad deal either, right?
