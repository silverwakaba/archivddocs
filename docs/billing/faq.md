You can cancel the plan you want to buy after you choose the payment channel. Therefore, if you want to cancel a purchase, choose the payment channel first. After that you will see a "Cancel Payment" button.

Confirm cancellation by clicking the **"Yes"** button. But if you are still unsure, you can postpone the payment by clicking the **"No"** or **"Cancel"** button.

You can also leave the purchase so that it is detected as an expired purchase.

## How do I get a refund?

As per the payment agreement which is displayed before each transaction, we do not accept requests for refunds in any form. However, we are still open to help if problems occur in the payment process.

Some of the provisions that apply include:

- If your payment is successful, your balance is deducted but you don't get the product you purchased, you can submit a support ticket. Later we will validate the report. If proven valid, we will help you get the product you purchased accompanied by compensation worth 25% of your total purchase.
  - Assuming you buy a duration of 100 days of premium and 100 GB datacap, this means that the compensation you receive is 25 days of premium and 25 GB datacap.
- If your payment is successful, your balance is not deducted and you get the product you purchased, you can assume that it is a bug in our system and you will not be charged for it. But of course we would really appreciate it if you could explain why this might happen. _Wink_.
- If your payment failed, your balance is deducted and you don't get the product you bought, you can submit a support ticket to the corresponding Bank you use for refund from them.

We will carry out the validation process by matching the data entered into the records provided by Midtrans as the payment gateway that we use.

- Payments whose status is valid by Midtrans but the transaction failed on ArchivD website are payments that are called valid and are entitled to compensation.
- Payments whose status is failed by Midtrans but the transaction failed on ArchivD website are payments that are called failed. You yourself must submit a refund application to the corresponding Bank.

We will attach the results of this match to each report you submit.

## What is the bandwidth limit for a free or paid user?

Both are unmetered. The only difference is the waiting time before downloading and the active period of the download link.

## What is the subscription type?

Currently the subscription type is a one-time payment, rather than a recurring payment. You can think of it as a one-time purchase product that continues to accumulate as long as you keep making purchases.

It can be said that one payment does not correlate with other payments, but will affect your entire account. Therefore you still have to manage renewal manually before your premium subscription expires.

## Can I become a reseller?

Anyone can become a reseller. Someone who wants to become a reseller only needs to gather the resources needed for them to sell.

For example, someone wants to focus on becoming a hotlink reseller, then they have to focus on collecting datacap resources. These resources can be obtained through purchasing reseller packages or by claiming SLA and gifts.

The data source of the reselling activity is the details attached to your account. For example, if you have a data cap of 10 GB, then you cannot sell more than that.

Or for another example, if you only have 10 days of premium duration left and then you sell all of those 10 days worth your premium duration, then you will automatically run out of premium duration.
