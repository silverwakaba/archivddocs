# Getting Started

Let's discover **ArchivD in less than 5 minutes**.

## What is ArchivD

ArchivD is a file hosting provider. We offer file hosting in both centralized and decentralized.

## Why should I use ArchivD

If you need a file hosting that offers you...

- No daily download quota.
- A large amounts of storage.
- Unthrottled download speeds.
- Files that can be downloaded anytime and by anyone.

...then ArchivD is the perfect solution for you.

## Can I search for files other people uploaded

You can share your files with others freely, but for privacy reasons you cannot search for others files.

## What kind of files can be uploaded

Any file can be uploaded into ArchivD: apps, photos, videos, archives... whatever, you name it.

But even so, there are still norms that must be maintained and not violated. We have classified this which [you can read here](/docs/legal-consent/tos#general-terms).

## Can I hotlink the stuff

You can hotlink the stuff as long as you still has a remaining data cap equivalent to the file size and the file is yours.

This means that you cannot hotlink the stuff if you don't have equivalent data cap to the file size and/or if the file is not yours.

You can purchase a data cap that suits your needs. These data caps are roll over, continue to accumulate when you purchase and will not reset. This means you can use the entire data cap for hotlinking purposes.

## I still have questions

Don't worry, you can contact us or ask your questions directly to the community.
