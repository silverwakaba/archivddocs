# File Dispute

This ArchivD File Dispute (the "Dispute") which explains how complainants ("reporter") can report content that they feel is inappropriate. Even so, this is not the final decision, because the reported party ("reported") can also challenge the report. In this case ArchivD ("we", "us", "our") will act as mediator. By using our services, reporter and reported agrees to be bound by all of the following dispute agreement:

## General Terms

In general, the following are the reasons you can use when reporting content, including but not limited to:

- We respect the copyright of others and require that users of our services comply with the laws of copyright. You are strictly prohibited from using our services to infringe copyright. You may not upload, download, store, share, display, stream, distribute, email, link to, transmit or otherwise make available any files, data, or content that infringes any copyright or other proprietary rights of any person or entity.
- In many laws, rules and norms pornographic content is prohibited, including on our platform. You may not upload, download, store, share, display, stream, distribute, email, link to, transmit or otherwise make available any files, data, or content that contains porn, in any form (images, video, text, etc).
- We believe that minor should be protected at all cost. You are strictly prohibited from using our services to infringe minor protection. You may not upload, download, store, share, display, stream, distribute, email, link to, transmit or otherwise make available any files, data, or content that contains harming the minor consciously and intentionally, in any form (gore, porn, sadism, etc). If proven will result in a permanent account ban, without any kind of discussion/dispute. If necessary ArchivD is willing to cooperate with any official/legal investigators.

## Applicable terms

Everyone comes from different places and of course has different views. Because of these differences, someone may feel that a piece of content violates the rules, while someone else may not.

So instead of making the wrong decision and unlike other places where the decision is ultimately in the hands of the provider, we created a dispute feature that both parties can use to find a final consensus.

This way decisions can be made quickly without you having to wait for an average response of 72 hours like elsewhere. *Wink*.
