# File Dispute

This ArchivD File Dispute (the "Dispute") which explains how complainants ("reporter") can report content that they feel is inappropriate. Even so, this is not the final decision, because the reported party ("reported") can also challenge the report. In this case ArchivD ("we", "us", "our") will act as mediator. By using our services, reporter and reported agrees to be bound by all of the following dispute agreement:

## General Terms

In general, the following are the reasons you can use when reporting content, including but not limited to:

- We respect the copyright of others and require that users of our services comply with the laws of copyright. You are strictly prohibited from using our services to infringe copyright. You may not upload, download, store, share, display, stream, distribute, email, link to, transmit or otherwise make available any files, data, or content that infringes any copyright or other proprietary rights of any person or entity.
- In many laws, rules and norms pornographic content is prohibited, including on our platform. You may not upload, download, store, share, display, stream, distribute, email, link to, transmit or otherwise make available any files, data, or content that contains porn, in any form (images, video, text, etc).
- We believe that minor should be protected at all cost. You are strictly prohibited from using our services to infringe minor protection. You may not upload, download, store, share, display, stream, distribute, email, link to, transmit or otherwise make available any files, data, or content that contains harming the minor consciously and intentionally, in any form (gore, porn, sadism, etc). If proven will result in a permanent account ban, without any kind of discussion/dispute. If necessary we are willing to cooperate with any official/legal investigators.

## Applicable terms

Everyone comes from different places and of course has different views. Because of these differences, someone may feel that a piece of content violates the rules, while someone else may not.

So instead of making the wrong decision and unlike other places where the decision is ultimately in the hands of the provider, we created a dispute feature that both parties can use to find a final consensus.

This way decisions can be made quickly without you having to wait for just an average response within 72 hours without getting any decision, like elsewhere.

## The Dispute

The dispute occurs between two parties, namely reporter and reported. The following is a more complete explanation.

### Reporter

Only certain people or institutions are eligible to become the reporter. Among them are:

- Government agencies.
- Official/legal investigators.
- The owner of a copyrighted works.
- A person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

If you meet any of the requirements below, please follow these steps to get a reporter account.

- If you don't have an account yet, [please register as new user](https://www.archivd.net/register) using business email.
- If you already have an account, please send an email to a@a.a containing:
    - A physical or electronic signature of the copyright owner or a person authorized to act on their behalf.
    - Your contact information including your name, address, telephone number, and an email address that you used to register.
    - State that you have a good faith belief that use of the content in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agents, or the law.
    - State that the information in the notification is accurate and under penalty of perjury the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
- After that, please wait until we finish verifying your request. If your request is accepted you will get a separate email with information stating that your account is accepted as a reporter.

### Reported

All registered users can get dispute reports without exception. However, users who receive a dispute report can submit an appeal.

## Dispute procedures

The dispute process has procedures that must be followed by both parties involved. Below we explain the procedure.

### Reporter raised a dispute report

A report will be initiated by the reporter. To be able to make a report, the reporter must first visit the file page they want to report. Later on the file page the reporter can click the **"Or report"** button, which is right below the download button.

After that, the reporter can complete the report with as detailed information as possible, such as the type of report and description of the report. If the file being reported has many parts then those parts can also be included in the **"related files"** column.

![File Dispute Step Two](/img/docs/legal-consent/dispute/02.webp)

Then, you will be directed to a new page which contains all the details and information from the report you have created. You can even embed additional information and answers in the message column if necessary, even before the reported person answers your report.

### Dispute report is ready

After the report is completed, the reporter and the reported party will communicate via the report details page which contains all the details and information from the report made by the reporter. Both parties then can communicate with each other, express opinions and submit objections to the report in the message column.

![File Dispute Step Three](/img/docs/legal-consent/dispute/03.webp)

Both parties can express their final decision using the buttons in the **"action"** column.

![File Dispute Step Four](/img/docs/legal-consent/dispute/04.webp)

The final decisions that can be reached include:

- If both parties agree, the file will be automatically deleted and the report will be closed.
- If both parties do not agree then the file will not be deleted and the report will be closed.
- Both parties can change their decision up to three days after the report was first made.
- If both parties do not reach the same final decision then one of our representatives will mediate and then make a final conclusion.

Therefore, in the first three days after the report was first made, our representatives will not intervene in the dispute.

Almost missed it. During this three day period, even though one party has made a final decision, but both parties can still communicate. This allows the discussion process to continue to be wide open.

With this feature, we hope that both parties involved can get a satisfactory decision. Cheers!
